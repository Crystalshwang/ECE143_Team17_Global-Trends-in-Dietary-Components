# Global-Trends-in-Dietary-Components
This is the final project for team 17 in ECE143, UCSD. We mainly focus on the global trends of the real world diet components. Food and dietary components are more and more important in our daily lives. In this project, we will explore the dataset from UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to analyse the global trend in dietary components. This allows us to see what we eat everyday and how does the trend change over the years.
